                <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> developed JavaScript, a computer
                language, in just ten days in May 1995. Initially called Mocha,
                then LiveScript, it finally became known as JavaScript. It was
                designed for the client-side of websites to add dynamic and
                interactive elements to static HTML pages.

              <p class="history__text">
                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a
                programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside
                HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
                for webpage behavior.[10] Web browsers have a dedicated
                JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines
                are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The
                most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
                that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic
                typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
                functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                Document Object Model (DOM) and
                <strong>Javascript has gained popularity since 2015</strong>

                JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create and
                manage dynamic web pages, basically anything that moves on your
                screen without requiring you to refresh your browser. It can be
                anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated
                Facebook timeline.

              <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
              <p class="about__text">
                JavaScript is an essential programming language, almost
                compulsory to learn for students or software developers that are
                gravitated towards web development. Wondering why? Here’s the
                answer: Javascript is the most popular programming language in
                the world and that makes it a default choice for web
                development. There are many frameworks available which you can
                use to create web applications once you have learned JavaScript.

              <h3>What is JavaScript Used For?</h3>
              <p class="about__text">
                JavaScript is used in various fields from the web to servers,
                and here’s a quick list of the significant areas it’s used in:
                Web Applications: JavaScript is used for adding interactivity
                and automation to websites. So, if you want your web application
                to be anything more than just a static page of contents, you’ll
                probably need to do some “JavaScript’ing.”

              Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that
              we're gonna be working with and storing in variables. In
              Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The
              five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans,
              undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types.

                JavaScript's number data type handles both integer and
                floating-point arithmetic, but not without its quirks and
                nuances-with implications for precision and performance that
                developers must be mindful of when performing mathematical
                operations.

              <p class="primitives__text">
                For text data, the JavaScript string data type comes into play,
                with an extensive suite of operations that allow for
                manipulation, examination, and transformation of textual data,
                essential for any kind of textual analysis or processing.

              <p class="primitives__title">Boolean</p>
              <p class="primitives__text">
                The boolean data type, with its two values of true and false,
                holds a critical role in flow control, enabling Javascript
                developers to execute different code paths through structures
                and perform conditional testing with clarity and precision.

                Lastly, for numbers that surpass the floating-point size that
                JavaScript's number type can accurately represent, there is
                bigint. This primitive data type allows for the representation
                of integers of arbitrary size, thus expanding the realm of
                numeric possibilities within a JavaScript application.

              <p class="primitives__text">
                The introduction of symbol data type in modern JavaScript offers
                unique and immutable values, predominantly used for object
                properties, that ensure an unassailable level of privacy and
                avoid property name collisions.

              <p class="primitives__text">
                Representing a deliberate absence of any object value, null is a
                primitive data type that is often used to intentionally denote
                that a variable is empty or to signal the end of a chain of
                objects.

              <p class="primitives__text">
                The undefined data type in JavaScript signifies the state of an
                uninitialized variable - a placeholder for variable value
                assignments yet to be made. It is a unique type that speaks to
                the very nature of JavaScript's variable declaration and the
                concept of hoisting.

                The Object type represents one of the JavaScript data types. It
                is used to store various keyed collections and more complex
                entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor
                or object initializer/literal syntax.
